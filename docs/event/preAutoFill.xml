	<description>
		This event is triggered when an fill action is about to write changes to a DataTable - it occurs after the fill drag has been completed and the new cell values computed, but before those values are written into the table.

		This event provides the ability to modify the new values, should that ability be required, by modifying the `set` parameter in the object that represents each cell from the fill. Please see the description in the `af-event autoFill` event for details about this parameter and how it can be accessed.
