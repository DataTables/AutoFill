Spreadsheets such as Excel and Google Docs have a very handy rapid data duplication auto fill UI method. The AutoFill library for DataTables provides a similar interface for DataTables (even extending upon it to provide complex data interaction options). AutoFill also provides full support for [Editor](https://editor.datatables.net) allowing end users to update data very quickly.
